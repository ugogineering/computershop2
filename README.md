Demo website for a computer shop

This is a demo website for a retail shop - in this case a computer shop. Is was built using HTML, CSS, javascript and some PHP code to process the contact form.

This code can be downloaded and used by anyone cutting their teeth in website design. Feel free to modify it and make it your own.

A functioning version of this demo website can be seen at https://caseray.com.ng/demoshop/ 

Cheers!
